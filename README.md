Titanic Classification Project
Overview
This repository contains code and resources for the Titanic Classification Project. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a passenger survived or not during the infamous sinking of the Titanic. The dataset used for this project is the famous "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset from Kaggle.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about Titanic passengers, including features such as age, sex, ticket class, cabin, fare, and whether they survived or not. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the machine learning model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance.

Project Structure
data/: This directory contains the dataset files, both the training set (train.csv) and the test set (test.csv).
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
src/: Python scripts containing the code for data preprocessing and model training.
models/: Trained machine learning models are saved in this directory.
requirements.txt: A list of required Python libraries for this project.
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is an essential step in any machine learning project. In the notebooks/ directory, you can find a Jupyter notebook dedicated to data exploration and preprocessing. It covers handling missing values, feature engineering, and data visualization.

Model Development
The main model used in this project is a Random Forest Classifier. The model development process is detailed in the Jupyter notebook located in the notebooks/ directory. We tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation.

Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated on the test set, and the results are presented in the Jupyter notebook in the notebooks/ directory. The evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Usage
To run the code in this repository, make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
After installing the required libraries, you can explore the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to understand the data preprocessing and model development process. To train the model and make predictions, you can run the Python scripts in the src/ directory.
